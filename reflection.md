Reflection and comments on the app and development process:

Our biggest challenge in creating the app, which we did not fully conquer coming into this milestone, was the layout and visual design, in particular we could still further improve on things such as:
The year slide-bar can be made smaller and positioned, layout of the graphs and possibly their size (two things that are intertwined in causing design problems), smooth out the interactivity of the different graphs (load time, visual cues), etc’.
In addition, may consider adding an option to show data over months rather then years, allowing for "yearly cycle" analysis as well.

In so far as addressing the feedback and suggestions by peers and staff:
Moved to documentation of issues through github ‘issues’, and updated readme to make it easier for users to understand what the app allows.
Updated the app description within the README to better represent the layout and functionality of out app.
Addressing the peer feedback for lab 4 of viz-1:
1. Added indicator to the area chart showing the Y value at each X axis value (year) when mouse hovers over it.
2. Did not implement the second suggestion, team believes it is more valuable to easily compare the different types of damage on the same plot, even if only proportionally, rather then seeing 4 separate plots 
3. Added some written explanation to what is being shown in each pane/graph to make things more clear for the user
